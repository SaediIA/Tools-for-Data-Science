# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[4]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result


# In[5]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
min = 200
hrs = min / 60
hrs


# **Objectives:**
